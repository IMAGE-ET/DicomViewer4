Getting the fpGui sources
=========================

    git clone git://github.com/graemeg/fpGUI.git

If you were in your home directory, for example `/home/leonardo`, the
previous command will create the directory /home/leonardo/fpGUI.

Now, from Lazarus go to Package->Open Package File (.lpk) and open
the package src/corelib/x11 or src/corelib/gdi (*nix / windows) and compile.

That's all.
